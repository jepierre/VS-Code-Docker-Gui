# VS Code Docker Gui

This is a template repository for running gui apps inside a docker container running on Windows.

According to this [article](https://blog.modest-destiny.com/posts/run-linux-gui-applications-within-docker-containers/) article[^1], there are 3 ways to run a gui app. The one I found to work best is the last option by running a VNC Server.
